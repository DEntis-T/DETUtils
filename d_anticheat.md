SA:MP AntiChat - basic anti-cheating system used to fight off the most famous hacks used by cheaters on verious servers.

## How to start to use?

- If you are making a gamemode script, don't worry about anything, just by including **d_samp.inc**, your anti-cheat system is ready to use after you start the script.

- But in order to work properly, you'll need to use anti-cheat functions instead of standard SA:MP functions. List of those functions is show below:

| SA:MP functions      | Anti-Cheat functions   | Description                                                        |
