# Information about the program

- Below you can see a library test log. Since this is an open-sourced library, I've decided to make this test log thing so I can log my progress and that progress is now available to everyone.

**NOTE:** This version of the library is a BETA version and is really unstable.
**WARNING:** I started test logging program on **13 Jan 2022**.
