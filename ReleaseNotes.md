-----------------------------

`DETUTILS` archive is a copy of an original source code, which is recommended to use as the GitHub source code contains documentation and extra files you aren't supposed to use or modify - or even have on your device.

-----------------------------

Simply install to your project and begin using the library with ***sampctl***:
```bat
sampctl package install samp-api/DETUtils
```
```pawn
#include <DETUTILS\detutils>
```

If you aren't a ***sampctl*** user, you can still download `DETUTILS` archive which matches your operating system from below, extract it into your `includes` folder and begin using the library with:
```pawn
#include <DETUTILS\detutils>
```
