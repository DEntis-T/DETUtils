# detutils.inc

DETUtils Entry Point - The main file which is included in order to use the DETUtils libraries, because including them like they're standalones is not a good idea.

## How to start to use?

- Start to use the DETUtils by including `detutils.inc`:

```pawn
#include <DETUTILS\detutils>
```

- Before including the entry point, you can define some compile-time options in order to configure the DETUtils libraries the way you want to.
