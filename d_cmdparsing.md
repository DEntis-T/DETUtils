# Parsing in ``d_commands``

- As I mentioned, parsing is analysing functions.

- In order to provide ``d_commands``' users an easier experience while tracking down bugs, I added new parsing feature to the include - which was VERY hard to make. Took me few days, by the way. What I was talking about is ``code-parse.inc`` include written by Y_Less.
