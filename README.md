## Troubleshooting

If you're facing problems like function failed to call, function is not valid, critical errors - make sure you enable automatic debugging.
- Automatic debugging literally sends debug messages whenever it needs to.
- With this feature you can easily track problems and report them on Discord or try to troubleshoot them yourself.

To enable A.D. feature, use:

```pawn
#define detutils_debug
```
